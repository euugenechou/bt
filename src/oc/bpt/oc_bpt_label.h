/* OC_BPT_LABEL.H
 *
 * A utility for labeling nodes. This is needed for cloning validation
 * tests. We'd like to be able to mark nodes, however, this can't be done
 * on the nodes themselves without marking them dirty. Therefore, we keep an
 * extra data-structure in memory. 
 *
 * Implementation: 
 *   build a hash-table with 10000 entries. This really needs to
 * be extensible, but we'll start with a staticly sized one.
 *
 * When a node-get-label call is made, check if the cell already
 * exists. If so, return a pointer to the integer value. Otherwise,
 * create a new cell.
